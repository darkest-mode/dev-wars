# DevWars!!!1!

DevWars!!!1!, by Darkest Mode, is a resource management game in the style of [Frank Lantz's](https://twitter.com/flantz) [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/).

### Darkest Mode

Darkest Mode are [Owen Corrigan](https://github.com/ojcorrigan) and [Zan Clifton](https://github.com/ZanClifton). They met on the [Northcoders Boot Camp](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp), where they began working on this project togther. Inspired by Lantz's use of Universal Paperclips to learn JavaScript, this is a tribute to both him and his game's concept. DevWars would be substantially further along if Owen and Zan played less Universal Paperclips and did more work.

### Using an Autoclicker

To make your life a little easier playing DevWars!!!1! (and any other idle clicker game), please make use of Zan's [handy, carpal-tunnel-avoiding autoclicker](https://github.com/ZanClifton/python-autoclicker). Injuries from repeated mouse-clicking are possible, and idle clicker games can be extremely difficult for people with conditions that affect their hands.
